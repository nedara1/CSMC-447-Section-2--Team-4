Role: Defines the data structures and schemas (Structure/Orgainization).


Why: Having a single source of truth for “what a Course looks like” (fields, types, indexes)
means validation, database queries, and in‑memory objects all line up.


course.js — Mongoose schema for your MongoDB collection.
    Mongoose is a Node.js library that is apart of MongoDB.
    Gives a way to work with data instead of raw JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files

classes.js — plain JS classes (Course, Plan) for front‑end or utility use.
